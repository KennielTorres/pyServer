# pyServer

A declarative and functional server programming language project created for my Programming Languages course(CIIC4030), on Spring Semester 2022. 

Technologies used: Python3 and PLY Library.

Overview:
Utilizing the PLY library, a new programming language, based on Python3, was created; it facilitates the communication between devices. 
The language provides simple functionality to create local servers and allow communication with external servers, utilizing python's built in sockets module.
